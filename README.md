# semantic-segmentation-pytorch-fcn-resnet50
This repository contains a project for semantic segmentation of images and videos using a Fully Convolutional Network- ResNet50  pretrained on the COCO dataset.

Create an outputs folder. This is where the analyzed images are saved. Execute the segment.py script with a script argument: --i "path to image" where you set the path to the image which will be anaylzed by the CNN.

Example:
